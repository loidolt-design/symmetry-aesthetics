Having a 'frozen face' from bad or overdone Botox was my biggest fear, but I definitely wanted some help with my frown lines. Devan was kind, patient, and professional. She helped soften the frown lines and it looked natural! No frozen face. Thank you Symmetry Aesthetics! I will be back!!",

She's a nurse which made me feel extra comfortable that she knew what she was doing and she also had amazing bedside manner which helped ease my nerves since it was my first time! There was honestly no pain and the service didn't take very long but the results were incredible! It's been almost two months now and my face still looks amazing and super natural. I still have movement in all the right places! My whole experience with her was everything I could have asked for and I can't wait for her to do my lips next!",
